            <h1>Hello, Triangle!</h1>
            <!-- BODY -->
            <p>In order to start working with WebGL we need to initialise it.
            To do that you need to access the canvas element you intend to draw on and saving it to a const.</p>
            
            <p>Then you need to get the context by accessing the newly created const (in this tutorial we will define it as `gl`) and calling <code><pre>gl.getContext('webgl')</pre></code></p>
            
            <p>At this point you should check that your const is not undefined / null and exit early if so.
            That's it!</p>
            
            <hr/>
            
            <p>Now to set the background colour on the canvas you can run `gl.clearColor(0, 0, 0, 1)`.
            The above colours are RGBA so this should default to black.
            Refreshing the page should not show any changes howevere. Why? Because we need to clear the buffer.</p>
            
            <p>The buffer stores changes incrementally and then clearing it performs an actual draw to the canvas.
            You can achieve this by running `gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);`</p>
            
            <p>Great. We now have a background with an arbitrary colour.</p>
            
            <hr/>
            
            <p>Now in order to start drawing shapes to the screen we need to build the graphics pipeline.
            Lets start by writing our GLSL shaders.
            Our vertex shader is responsible for drawing the lines which define our shape; it transforms 3D objects vertices into 2D screen coordinates.
            Our vertex shader will look like the following;</p>
        
<pre><code>
precision mediump float;
        
attribute vec2 vertPosition;
        
void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(vertPosition, 0.0, 1.0);
}
</code></pre>
        
            <p>next we will write our fragmentShader;
            <b><i>// TODO - write-up more about what a fragment shader is / does.</i></b></p>
        
<pre><code>
precision medium float;
        
void main()
{
    gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}
</code></pre>
        
            <p>Now we have our vertex and fragment shaders, we can use them to begin drawing.</p>
            
            <p>To initialise a shader we run `gl.createShader(gl.VERTEX_SHADER);` or `gl.createShader(gl.FRAGMENT_SHADER);` depending on the type. 
            Assign the output to an appropriately named variable, say `vertexShader` and then from that you can call `gl.shaderSource(vertexShader, vertexShaderText);`
            Finally to compile the shader for use you should run `gl.compileShader(vertexShader);`.</p>
            
            <p>This process of compiling the shader may fail silently. To check the process you can run;</p>

<pre><code>
gl.getShaderParameter(vertexShader, gl.COMPILE_STATUS);
</code></pre>

            <p>If this returns false / null then something went wrong on compile.
            You can get details of the issue by running `gl.getShaderInfoLog(vertexShader);` to find out the specifics of what went wrong.</p>
            
            <p>Now we have our shaders, we need to create our program and link to our context.
            To do this you run `gl.createProgram()` and assign to a variable, say `program`.
            Then you run `gl.attachShader(program, vertexShader)` to make our shader available to the program, before running `gl.linkProgram(program)`.</p>
        
            <p>this point we can check the validity of our program by running `gl.getProgramParameter(program, gl.LINK_STATUS)` to check our program linked correctly.
            The `getProgramParameter` works similarly to the `getShaderParameter` above.
            We can also use `getProgramInfoLog` to get more accurate error reporting.
            Another thing we can do is run `gl.validateProgram(program);` and then do a check on `gl.VALIDATE_STATUS` in the same manner.</p>
            
            <hr/>
            
            <p>Right, now we're going to begin drawing our triangle.</p>
            
            <p>Firstly we need to create a list of our vertices coordinates.
            The coordinates we use are relative to our viewpoint, i.e screen coordinates.
            The coordinates are, as follows, in X and Y pairs;</p>
        
<pre><code>
const triangleVertices = [
    0.0, 0.5,
    -0.5, -0.5,
    0.5, -0.5
]
</code></pre>
        
            <p>Now in order to start using our vertex data we need to create a "buffer", a space in the GPUs memory to pass data. To do this we run `const buffer = gl.createBuffer();` and then we bind this buffer to our context by running `gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer);`.
            Finally to send this data to our buffer we run `gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array(triangleVertices), gl.STATIC_DRAW);`</p>
            
            <p>Now we've send the data to the GPU we need to inform the vertexShader that the pairs of coordinates should map to the vec2 `vertPosition`.</p>
        
<pre><code>
const positionAttributeLocation = gl.getAttribLocation(program, 'vertPosition');
gl.vertexAttribPointer(
    positionAttributeLocation,
    2,
    gl.FLOAT,
    gl.FALSE,
    2 * Float32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT,
    0
);
gl.enableVertexAttribArray(positionAttributeLocation);
</code></pre>
        
            <p>Finally we will draw our triangle to the screen.
            We will run `useProgram` to use the WebGL program we've created and then run `drawArrays`.</p>
        
<pre><code>
gl.useProgram(program);
gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
</code></pre>
        
            <p>The `drawArrays` parameters are;</p>
            <ol>
            <li>The 'mode' for drawing (triangles is applicable in 99% of cases)</li>
            <li>The 'offset' for our vertices, which is why we're setting 0 - we don't want to skip any</li>
            <li>The number of vertices to draw; 3 is the number in a single triangle.</li>
            </ol>
